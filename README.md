## About Tetra Web

Tetra Web is an extension of the Tetra bot project, created to expand the possibilities of the Tetra bot creation process by providing users and developers with more advanced features compared to the limitations of Discord enviroment.

Using the application is optional and not required to use the bot.

Tetra Web introduces manual emote adjustment (which can offer better results) and other advanced emote management features, such as mass importing.

Additionally, the website serves as a bot showcase page.
